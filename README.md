# FI-LPCMCI: Feature Importance-based LPCMCI

FI-LPCMCI is a hybrid causal discovery framework designed for multivariate, high-dimensional, and non-linear time series data. This approach is particularly useful for uncovering causal relationships in complex systems. In our example, we try to untangle aerosol-cloud interactionsâ€”one of the key sources of uncertainty in climate modeling.
